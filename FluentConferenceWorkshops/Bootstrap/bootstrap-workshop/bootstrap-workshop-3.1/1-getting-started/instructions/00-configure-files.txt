1. Create a folder on your desktop called "fruit". This is our working directory for the project.

2. Download Bootstrap 3 from http://www.getbootstrap.com. You need 3 folders: css, fonts, js. In the current distribution, these are in a folder called "dist" in the downloaded zip. Copy these three folders into the fruit folder.

You will also need the folder called "less" from the same zip. Copy this to the fruit folder as well.

3. Go to http://www.jquery.com and download the latest 1.x series file for production. I will be using jquery-1.10.2.min.js, which is available in the workshop file distribution. Copy this file to the js folder inside of the fruit folder.

4. Create a folder inside of the fruit folder called img. Go to the images folder inside of bootstrap-workshop and copy all images from here to the img folder. Preserve the file and folder structure. (You do not have to copy the text credits file.)

5. Create a blank css document inside of the css folder called custom.css

6. Copy index.html to the fruit folder. (This is a basic starting HTML5 document.)

7. The final folder and file structure inside of the fruit folder should be as follows:

fruit
	css
		bootstrap.css
		bootstrap.min.css
		bootstrap-theme.min.css
		bootstrap-theme.css
		custom.css
	
	glyphicons
		glyphiconshalflines-regular.eot, .svg, .ttf, .woff

	img
		2 folders of images (large, thumbs) plus 15 individual images in this folder

	js
		bootstrap.js
		bootstrap.min.js
		jquery-1.10.2.min.js

	index.html

8. Add the viewport meta tag to the head of the document:
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


9. Link the bootstrap.min.css and custom.css files in the head of the document.
    <link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="css/custom.css" rel="stylesheet">

10. At the bottom of the document, just before the </body> tag, link to the jquery and bootstrap.min.js documents:

	<!-- javascript -->
	<script src="js/jquery-1.10.2.min.js"></script>
    	<script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
